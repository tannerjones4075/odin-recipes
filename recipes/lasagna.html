    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p class="description">When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how
        successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
        than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two
        decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old — read all about his life and legacy here.

        <li class="li-design">1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li class="li-design">½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li class="li-design">¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li class="li-design">12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li class="li-design">16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li class="li-design">1 egg</li>
        <li class="li-design">¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li class="li-design">¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Gather all your ingredients. </li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
            basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
            minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella
            cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li class="li-design-ordered">Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
